  <p>  AI is concerned with the design and implementation of computer systems
    capable of solving problems that usually require the ability of human beings. Such
    problems correspond to a high complexity or to natural tasks (e.g. vision or natural
    language understanding). They usually cannot be solved by classical algorithmic
    methods. For solving them, AI programs mainly manipulate symbolic information and
    not only numerical data as usual in computer science.
     AI makes an extensive use of various kinds of knowledge about a domain of
    application. Therefore the problems of knowledge acquisition, representation and use
    are central in AI research and development. The implementation of knowledge-based
    systems represents one of the most active branches.
     An important characteristic of AI is its pluridisciplinarity. AI has strong
    relationships with computer science, but the development of AI projects necessitates
    also notions coming from logic, linguistics, cognitive sciences, etc. Besides, AI is used
    in a large variety of application fields: medicine, industry, bank and finance, etc.
